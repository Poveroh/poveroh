# Configure your project

Welcome to Poveroh Storybook! This is your component library documentation.

## Getting Started

Because Storybook works separately from your app, you'll need to configure it for your specific stack and setup. Below, explore guides for configuring Storybook with popular frameworks and tools.

### Add styling and CSS

Like with web applications, there are many ways to include CSS within Storybook. Learn more about setting up styling within Storybook.

[Learn more about styling →](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure/styling-and-css/?renderer=react)

### Provide context and mocking

Often when a story doesn't render, it's because your component is expecting a specific environment or context (like a theme provider) to be available.

[Learn more about context →](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/decorators/?renderer=react#context-for-mocking)

### Load assets and resources

To link static files (like fonts) to your projects and stories, use the `staticDirs` configuration option to specify folders to load when starting Storybook.

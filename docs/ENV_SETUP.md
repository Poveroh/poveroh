# Environment Variables

Environment variables are stored in a single file but are divided by application.

For development and local deployment, either copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` manually or run `npm run setup:env`.
This will copy the file and populate it with default values. However, for improved application security, it is recommended to replace these defaults with your own custom values.

All applications retrieve the necessary variables from this file.

There are also `.env` files inside `packages/prisma`, `apps/app`, `apps/api` and `docker` folder that directly link to `.env` file in project root. Do not touch them.

## Database

```
POSTGRES_USER=poveroh
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=poveroh
POSTGRES_DB=poveroh

# For local development, the host is 'localhost:5432'
# For local deploy (docker), the host is 'db:5432'
# For production, insert url you need
DATABASE_HOST=db:5432

#Database connection string for Prisma; don't touch this
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${DATABASE_HOST}/${POSTGRES_DB}
```

## Api

```
#API port; default is 3001
API_PORT=3001

# JWT secret key
